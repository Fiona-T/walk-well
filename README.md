## Purpose
Walk Well is a website dedicated to the practice of mindful walking and has two distinct purposes:
1) provides users with simple, easily accessible information on how they can incorporate meditation into their daily movement with the practice of mindful walking. 
2) provides information about the events we run, which are small guided group walking sessions for participants to experience a longer and structured mindfulness session and connect with like-minded individuals.

Mindful walking is a very simple technique that almost anyone could incorporate into their day. It is free, quick, simple, requires no special equipment and can be incorporated into existing daily schedules. It makes meditation and mindfulness more accessible by 1) combining it with the act of walking/moving about which is something a lot of us do daily and are familiar with and 2) easily integrating mindfulness into existing routines without having to dedicate extra time to it. 

Many added walking into their daily routine due to the pandemic restrictions because they couldn't access gyms or other forms of exercise. The information and tools on the website aim to encourage people to not only keep up a daily walking habit but also show them that mindfulness is a versatile tool that can be added to any walk, even part of a commute, to reap additional benefits.

The events and group walks add a community feel and help people further their knowledge on the area of walking, mindfulness and meditation.

The target audience therefore is quite wide, but broadly speaking is people with an interest in health, mental wellbeing, mindfulness, meditation, yoga; as well as people who are curious about meditation and mindfulness but maybe have never tried it. The target audience is located in Ireland since the events and group walks are based in and around Dublin.
