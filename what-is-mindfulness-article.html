                <h3>What is mindfulness?</h3>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>“Mindfulness refers to the awareness that emerges by paying attention, on purpose, non
                        judgementally to the present moment.” (Jon Kabat-Zinn)</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>Mindfulness is the practice of ‘being fully present in the moment’. It’s a different sort of
                    awareness to the ‘automatic pilot’ that we are so often immersed in - like when we’re driving or
                    walking and don’t notice the details of the journey because we’re lost in thought. It can often
                    be very difficult to be ‘in the moment’ as we can very easily become distracted by what is going
                    on around us or by our own thoughts. People can ‘train’ to be more mindful in many ways such as
                    through doing mindfulness courses, listening to cds, reading books or participating in
                    mindfulness retreats, although probably the most helpful way to learn is with an experienced
                    mindfulness teacher.</p>
                <h3>What mindfulness is not:</h3>
                <p>It’s not relaxation; it’s not a religion; it’s not about getting rid of thoughts; it’s not about
                    being calm all the time; it’s not about being ‘nice’ all the time. It’s not even about feeling
                    good all the time either!</p>
                <h3>How does mindfulness work?</h3>
                <p>People who practice mindfulness learn to become familiar with their own ‘habits of mind’. Through
                    regular practice they begin to notice how they often react rather than respond. They become more
                    familiar with their body-mind connection and they learn to cultivate a kinder, more
                    compassionate response to their own experience. To help them do this they may spend some time
                    every day practising some mindfulness practices such as the body scan, sitting meditation,
                    mindful movement and mindful eating.</p>
                <h3>Is mindfulness new?</h3>
                <p>Mindfulness has been part of Judeo Christian and Buddhist teachings for centuries. In 1979 Jon
                    Kabat Zinn developed an eight-week programme called Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) to
                    teach mindfulness to people who had chronic illness and pain. Kabat Zinn is an American
                    molecular biologist who is now Professor of Medicine Emeritus and he demonstrated through
                    research that mindfulness was very beneficial. The MBSR programme was later adapted by three
                    psychologists, Prof. Zindel Segal, Prof. Mark Williams and Prof. John Teasdale as Mindfulness
                    Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) to prevent relapse of depression.</p>
                <h3>Why do people talk about ‘practising’ mindfulness?</h3>
                <p>Training to be mindful is only the start. Even very experienced practitioners of mindfulness
                    refer to it as a ‘practice’. It takes practice, lots of practice, to stay fully in the present.
                    A regular meditation practice is considered very important in cultivating and sustaining
                    mindfulness.</p>
                <h3>Is there any evidence that mindfulness works?</h3>
                <p>Yes. There are many reputable studies to show that mindfulness is effective in reducing levels of
                    stress, anxiety, depression, anger and worry. People who practise mindfulness on a regular basis
                    have been found to be better able to regulate their sense of wellbeing due to greater emotional
                    awareness, understanding and acceptance.</p>
                <p>MBCT has been found to be significantly effective in reducing relapse rate in major depression
                    and now its use is broadened to treating current depression and other psychological disorders
                    (Segal, Williams at al 2002). The UK National Institute of Clinical Excellence (NICE) has
                    endorsed MBCT as an effective treatment for relapse prevention. Learning to cultivate
                    mindfulness has been found to be effective for people who have physical health difficulties such
                    as chronic pain, chronic fatigue syndrome and cancer.</p>
                <p>Many research studies have demonstrated that there can actually be changes in the brain structure
                    of people who practise mindfulness meaning that they are better able to respond to stressors.

                <p>As an introduction, you can watch the lecture below that Dr. Paul D’Alton gave as part of the
                    Aware lecture series in January 2015. Entitled: ‘New Year, New You? How mindfulness can help’.
