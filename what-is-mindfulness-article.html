            <h3>What is mindfulness?</h3>
            <blockquote><p>“Mindfulness refers to the awareness that emerges by paying attention, on purpose, non judgementally to the present moment.” (Jon Kabat-Zinn)</p></blockquote>
            <p>Mindfulness is the practice of ‘being fully present in the moment’. It’s a different sort of awareness to the ‘automatic pilot’ that we are so often immersed in - like when we’re driving or walking and don’t notice the details of the journey because we’re lost in thought. It can often be very difficult to be ‘in the moment’ as we can very easily become distracted by what is going on around us or by our own thoughts. People can ‘train’ to be more mindful in many ways such as through doing mindfulness courses, listening to cds, reading books or participating in mindfulness retreats, although probably the most helpful way to learn is with an experienced mindfulness teacher.</p>
            <h3>What mindfulness is not:</h3>
            <p>It’s not relaxation; it’s not a religion; it’s not about getting rid of thoughts; it’s not about being calm all the time; it’s not about being ‘nice’ all the time. It’s not even about feeling good all the time either!</p>
            <h3>How does mindfulness work?</h3>
            <p>People who practice mindfulness learn to become familiar with their own ‘habits of mind’. Through regular practice they begin to notice how they often react rather than respond. They become more familiar with their body-mind connection and they learn to cultivate a kinder, more compassionate response to their own experience. To help them do this they may spend some time every day practising some mindfulness practices such as the body scan, sitting meditation, mindful movement and mindful eating.</p>
            <h3>Is mindfulness new?</h3>
            <p>Mindfulness has been part of Judeo Christian and Buddhist teachings for centuries. In 1979 Jon Kabat Zinn developed an eight-week programme called Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) to teach mindfulness to people who had chronic illness and pain. Kabat Zinn is an American molecular biologist who is now Professor of Medicine Emeritus and he demonstrated through research that mindfulness was very beneficial. The MBSR programme was later adapted by three psychologists, Prof. Zindel Segal, Prof. Mark Williams and Prof. John Teasdale as Mindfulness Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) to prevent relapse of depression.</p>
            <h3>Why do people talk about ‘practising’ mindfulness?</h3>
            <p>Training to be mindful is only the start. Even very experienced practitioners of mindfulness refer to it as a ‘practice’. It takes practice, lots of practice, to stay fully in the present. A regular meditation practice is considered very important in cultivating and sustaining mindfulness.</p>
            <h3>Is there any evidence that mindfulness works?</h3>
            <p>Yes. There are many reputable studies to show that mindfulness is effective in reducing levels of stress, anxiety, depression, anger and worry. People who practise mindfulness on a regular basis have been found to be better able to regulate their sense of wellbeing due to greater emotional awareness, understanding and acceptance </p>
            <p>MBCT has been found to be significantly effective in reducing relapse rate in major depression and now its use is broadened to treating current depression and other psychological disorders (Segal, Williams at al 2002). The UK National Institute of Clinical Excellence (NICE) has endorsed MBCT as an effective treatment for relapse prevention. Learning to cultivate mindfulness has been found to be effective for people who have physical health difficulties such as chronic pain, chronic fatigue syndrome and cancer.</p>
            <p>Many research studies have demonstrated that there can actually be changes in the brain structure of people who practise mindfulness meaning that they are better able to respond to stressors.</p>
            <h3>How can I find out more about mindfulness?</h3>
            <p>As an introduction, you can watch the lecture below that Dr. Paul D’Alton gave as part of the Aware lecture series in January 2015. Entitled: ‘New Year, New You? How mindfulness can help’.</p>
