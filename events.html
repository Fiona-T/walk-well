                <p>I attended the Ticknock walk at the end of January and it really gave me a different perspective on meditation and mindfulness. I've walked on this route previously but the addition of mindful walking really changed the experience for me. I've started using some of the techniques in my walk to work and it has brought so much more calm into my life. Highly recommend!</p>

                <p>I started doing the Mindful Mornings, that run every Monday, a few weeks ago and now I would not be without them! They really set me up for the day and set a good tone for the week ahead. I only wish they ran every morning!!</p>

                <p>I was sceptical about the Forest Bathing but went along with my wife as she had gone on a session previously and raved about the benefits. I wasn't expecting to enjoy it and thought I'd feel self conscious and out of place, but our instructor Adam put my fears to rest. The hour flew by and I felt rejuvenated and more connected to myself at the end. I can't wait to go on a longer session and I use some of the tips on my daily walks. Great event all round!</p>
