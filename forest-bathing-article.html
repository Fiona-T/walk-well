                    beneficial for body and soul. Now the practice is becoming more popular in some Western
                    societies</p>

                <p>Every day, apart from when it’s raining heavily, Dr Qing Li heads to a leafy park near the Nippon
                    Medical School in Tokyo where he works. It’s not just a pleasant place to eat his lunch; he
                    believes the time spent under the trees’ canopy is a critical factor in the fight against
                    diseases, of the mind and body.</p>
                <h3>Shinrin-yoku</h3>
                <p>Once a month Li spends three days in forests near Tokyo, using all five senses to connect with
                    the environment and clear his mind. This practice of shinrin-yoku – literally, forest bath – has
                    the power to counter illnesses including cancer, strokes, gastric ulcers, depression, anxiety
                    and stress, he says. It boosts the immune system, lowers blood pressure and aids sleep.</p>
                <p>Shinrin-yoku was developed in the 1980s in Japan. Although people had been taking walks in the
                    country’s forests for centuries, new studies showed that such activity could reduce blood
                    pressure, lower cortisol levels and improve concentration and memory. A chemical released by
                    trees and plants, called phytoncides, was found to boost the immune system. As more research
                    highlighted the benefits of shinrin-yoku, the Japanese government incorporated it into the
                    country’s health programme.</p>
                <h3>Listen to the wind and taste the air</h3>
                <p>Li – now president of the Society for Forest Medicine in Japan, and the author of Shinrin-Yoku:
                    The Art and Science of Forest Bathing – is a world expert and has conducted numerous studies.
                    “It’s a preventative medicine, not a treatment,” he told us. People spend their lives
                    increasingly indoors, he said. About 80% of Japan’s population lives in urban areas, and the
                    average American now spends more than 90% of their time indoors. But we are designed to be
                    connected to the natural world, to “listen to the wind and taste the air”.</p>
                <p>His book offers this advice for the practice of shinrin-yoku: <q>“Make sure you have left your phone
                        and camera behind. You are going to be walking aimlessly and slowly. You don’t need any devices.
                        Let your body be your guide. Listen to where it wants to take you. Follow your nose. And take
                        your time. It doesn’t matter if you don’t get anywhere. You are not going anywhere. You are
                        savouring the sounds, smells and sights of nature and letting the forest in.”</q></p>
                <h3>Mindful time under the trees</h3>
                <p>Gary Evans, who set up the Forest Bathing Institute in the UK last year, said: “People initially
                    think they’ve been doing this all their lives: going for a walk in the woods. But it might be a
                    brisk walk, or you might be worrying about where the dog has got to. “A better way to frame
                    forest bathing is mindful time spent under the canopy of trees for health and wellbeing
                    purposes.”</p>
                <p>A typical session might last three hours, and begin with an explanation of the history and
                    science of shinrin-yoku. “Then it’s about sensory exercises,” said Evans. “We try to hold
                    people’s attention in the present moment, to give their bodies and minds a chance to slow down.
                    We move very slowly, touching the trees, looking at colours and patterns, and breathing deeply.
                    We end up lying down under trees and looking up through the branches.”</p>
                <p>Shades of green and blue, the colours of the forest and the sky, were the most relaxing, he said.
                    Looking at nature’s patterns helped to stop thoughts spinning in the head.</p>
                <h3>Psychological benefits</h3>
                <p><a href="https://www.kcl.ac.uk/archive/news/ioppn/records/2018/january/study-suggests-exposure-to-trees-the-sky-and-birdsong-in-cities-beneficial-for-mental-wellbeing"
                        target="_blank" rel="noopener">One UK study, carried out by King’s College London</a> and
                    published in January 2018,
                    found that exposure to trees, the sky and birdsong in cities improved mental wellbeing. The
                    benefits were still evident several hours after the exposure. “Even just 20 minutes can help,
                    though 10 hours a month is even better,” said Stuart Dainton of the Woodland Trust. “If you live
                    in a city, you may not be able to get to a forest easily, but taking off your shoes in the park
                    and feeling the grass will help you de-stress.”</p>
                <p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6313311/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A
                        study of 585 Japanese people published last year </a>said that city dwellers were
                    “constantly
                    exposed to stressors” and that “urban living is associated with increased risk of health
                    problems”, including anxiety, depression and psychosis. It concluded: <q>“The psychological
                        benefits of walking through forests are very significant … Urban planners should pay more
                        attention to maintaining and increasing accessible greenery in urban areas. The beneficial
                        effects of nature suggest a simple, accessible and cost-effective method to improve the quality
                        of life and health of urban residents.”</q></p>
